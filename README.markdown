# Gargantuan!!!

(A minimal web framework written in php.)

As this is framework is written as an exercise/proof of concept, several functionalities which you may have come to expect from a modern framework is missing. These are "left as an exercise for the reader".

The framework is heavily inspired of [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/ "Web development that doesn't hurt")

## How the what now?

So, you got the idea that using this framework in your own project would be a great idea. Are you really sure about that? I wouldn't use it and I wrote it...

### Getting the source

As you're reading this you probably already got the source somehow. But I digress...

The latest version of the source is available in a public repository on [github](https://github.com/asheidan/Gargantuan).

#### The easy way

The easiest way to obtain it (and keeping it updated) is using it as a [git submodule](http://book.git-scm.com/5_submodules.html "More information about submodules in git").

#### Two more (boring) ways

1. Clone the repository. Don't do this if you use git in your project, then you should really look into git submodules.

		$ git clone \
			https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git \
			${path_to_project_libs}/Gargantuan

2. Download the source as a tarball from github at [https://github.com/asheidan/Gargantuan/archives/master]()
